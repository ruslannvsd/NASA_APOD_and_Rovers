# NASA_APOD_and_Rovers
NASA's A picture of a day and photos made by rovers on Mars.

The first page allows a user to choose between opening
a todayâ€™s picture of the day (plus nine random old ones)
or page with photos made by one of Martian rovers.

There are also fields to choose the sol (a Martian day)
and the least quality of images to populate the next page.
Other pages handle photos depending on the choice a user made.

Bonus features: sharing and copying information of a chosen photo,
setting a wallpaper, opening videos (if any) in external applications.
